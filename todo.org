* Store the data in a data format
If we store in a data storage format, we can generate the markdown
from there, including an easier way to model tags, as well as do
something like generate periodic thumbnails via:

#+begin_src js
npx pageres-cli http://ahungry.com 800x600 --filename=x --scale=0.25 --overwrite
#+end_src

and include the thumbnails inline with the entries.

This may give it more of a "gallery" feel rather than a giant list of
text.
