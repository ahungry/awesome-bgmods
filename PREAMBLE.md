# Awesome BGMods (Baldur's Gate Mods)

Curated list of BG:EET Infinity Engine mods (maybe some non-EET ones
as well).

<details>
<summary>Note about the purpose of this</summary>

I hope to maintain a healthy list/index of mods, including homepage
and direct download links, as well as any quick
comments/findings/known issues with incompatabilites.

There are tons of great mods out there, however due to some general
aversion to re-hosting/mirroring of mods, sometimes they are quite
segmented between a lot of different mod communities/personal hosting
pages/github repos - this should hopefully provide someone (at the
least, myself) a quick reference.

The target audience of this document will already have some
familiarity with installing IE mods (Weidu/weinstall), although I will
include links to some non-Weidu based tooling as well.

# Mods

Mod categories are listed in the (generally) recommended mod install
order for an EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy) install, and the
individual mods listed in each block are placed in the order I have
personally tested/installed them in the past (for mods I've tried
out).

Badges look like this, and it is not an endorsement or review on the
quality of the mod - just that it was successfully installed and
didn't have any obvious game breaking errors in tandem with other mods.

![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/cmp-ahungry001-teal?style=plastic)

This implies that all items with this badge were able to play nicely
while installed in tandem with each other, without hitting any conflicts.

If you see
![conflicts](https://img.shields.io/badge/conflicts-LeUI-yellow?style=plastic)
then that means choose one or the other, not both.

If you don't want to use EET, the mods in the first section (Pre-EET)
should be good for a BG:EE game, but not for a BG2:EE, however some of
the mods in the Post-EET section may be good for a BG:EE as well
(refer to individual mod documentation).

FIXME: In this early draft, I'm pasting links I've used for personal
reference - I will want to update them to the proper homepages vs
direct download links, but you may find some of one or the other atm).

## Legend

Mods are either "pre:eet" or "post:eet" type - this implies where the
mod should be installed in the install order.

For most installs, you should do something roughly like (well, what
worked for me):

Misc. -> UI -> Items -> Quests -> NPCs -> Voice/Portraits -> Gameplay
-> SCS/Tactics -> Tweaks -> End of Order

There are a lot of Windows based mod management/installation tools
(Project Infinity is one, up top I will try to build out links to
others).  There aren't a lot of GNU/Linux tools - maybe someday (at
least Near Infinity is there though!).
