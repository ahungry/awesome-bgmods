## Legend

Mods are either "pre:eet" or "post:eet" type - this implies where the
mod should be installed in the install order.

For most installs, you should do something roughly like (well, what
worked for me):

Misc. -> UI -> Items -> Quests -> NPCs -> Voice/Portraits -> Gameplay
-> SCS/Tactics -> Tweaks -> End of Order

There are a lot of Windows based mod management/installation tools
(Project Infinity is one, up top I will try to build out links to
others).  There aren't a lot of GNU/Linux tools - maybe someday (at
least Near Infinity is there though!).
