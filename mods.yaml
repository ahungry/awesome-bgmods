      Tactics, originally from Wes Weimer and a number of other
      authors, was a mod for the original Baldur's Gate II that added
      a number of difficult encounters and substantially improved AI
      for enemies. With Wes's permission morpheus562 has created
      Tactics Remix, based the original Tactics mod, that adds quite
      a few optional, but difficult, encounters to BG2:EE and EET
      aimed to make the game more challenging and rewarding.

      updates.
      This is an alpha release with the intention of adding more
      class, skill, and stat updates in the near future while further
      refining the new proficiencies that are being added.

      From quality of life (QOL) features, to rebalancing weapon
      proficiencies, this tweak pack offers a lot.
