       This WeiDU mod adds a great deal of content by expanding
       the depth of character and levels of interaction of the
       NPCs in Baldur's Gate. It also provides some optional
       tweaks to the BG portion of the game. Available in
       English, Spanish, French, Polish, and German, this
       version ships with WeiDU v246. Banters, player-initiated
       dialogues, romances, quests, tweaks, and interjections
       enhance your BG experience when you add this mod to your
       Tutu, BGT, BGEE, or EET game. We suggest pairing the mod
       with the optional Music Pack.

       No Banter is a small mod for Baldur's Gate 2 that
       disables party banter. While party banter can be
       immersive and revealing, it can also break immersion.
       How likely is it that party members would begin a banter
       while exploring a dark forbidding dungeon? Or while sneaking
       through an enemy stronghold? Or while disguised in a drow stronghold?

      her friends among the people she meets, and the feeling of
      initial dislike is usually mutual. But underneath her
      prickly manners, she has a good heart and is prepared to
      go to great lengths to help those who she sees to be weak
      and in need of aid.

      just needs someone to talk to. There are dialogue options
      that reflect the game story and I'll promise: Grey will
      always listen to your PC's woes. Grey initiates no
      dialogues so there is no friendship track and - I am

      Was that truly the ending to Yoshimo's adventures with the
      Bhaalspawn? Is there simply no way to redeem himself or
      explain his actions to the PC? Yoshimo's Remorse is a mod
      for BG2:ToB that makes Yoshimo a playable character in
      Throne of Bhaal. However, he is not what you expect him to
      be... So prepare yourself for some more adventures and
      talks with the infamous bounty hunter, a tormented soul
      that was left with nothing but regrets. Listen to him as
      this may be his last chance to find peace.

      Tactics, originally from Wes Weimer and a number of other
      authors, was a mod for the original Baldur's Gate II that added
      a number of difficult encounters and substantially improved AI
      for enemies. With Wes's permission morpheus562 has created
      Tactics Remix, based the original Tactics mod, that adds quite
      a few optional, but difficult, encounters to BG2:EE and EET
      aimed to make the game more challenging and rewarding.
