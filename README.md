# Awesome BGMods (Baldur's Gate Mods)

Curated list of Infinity Engine mods (should this be limited to mods
that have been successfully integrated with the EE?).

## Note

I hope to maintain a healthy list/index of mods, including homepage
and direct download links, as well as any quick
comments/findings/known issues with incompatabilites.

There are tons of great mods out there, however due to some general
aversion to re-hosting/mirroring of mods, sometimes they are quite
segmented between a lot of different mod communities/personal hosting
pages/github repos - this should hopefully provide someone (at the
least, myself) a quick reference.

The target audience of this document will already have some
familiarity with installing IE mods (Weidu/weinstall), although I will
include links to some non-Weidu based tooling as well.

# Mods

Mod categories are listed in the (generally) recommended mod install
order for an EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy) install.

If you don't want to use EET, the mods in the first section (BG:EE)
should be good for a BG:EE game, but not for a BG2:EE, however some of
the mods in the Post-EET section may be good

## Pre-EET

Install/setup before EET
