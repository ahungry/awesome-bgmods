# Awesome BGMods (Baldur's Gate Mods)

Curated list of BG:EET Infinity Engine mods (maybe some non-EET ones
as well).

<details>
<summary>Note about the purpose of this</summary>

I hope to maintain a healthy list/index of mods, including homepage
and direct download links, as well as any quick
comments/findings/known issues with incompatabilites.

There are tons of great mods out there, however due to some general
aversion to re-hosting/mirroring of mods, sometimes they are quite
segmented between a lot of different mod communities/personal hosting
pages/github repos - this should hopefully provide someone (at the
least, myself) a quick reference.

The target audience of this document will already have some
familiarity with installing IE mods (Weidu/weinstall), although I will
include links to some non-Weidu based tooling as well.

# Mods

Mod categories are listed in the (generally) recommended mod install
order for an EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy) install, and the
individual mods listed in each block are placed in the order I have
personally tested/installed them - if future ones are inserted
in-between ones I've personally tested by other contributors, it will
be noted by a different badge.

Badge looks like this, and is not an endorsement or review on the
quality of the mod - just that it was successfully installed and
didn't have any obvious game breaking errors in tandem with other mods:

If you don't want to use EET, the mods in the first section (Pre-EET)
should be good for a BG:EE game, but not for a BG2:EE, however some of
the mods in the Post-EET section may be good for a BG:EE as well
(refer to individual mod documentation).

FIXME: In this early draft, I'm pasting links I've used for personal
reference - I will want to update them to the proper homepages vs
direct download links, but you may find some of one or the other atm).

## Pre-EET

Install/setup before EET.  Many of these lack an awareness of an EET
setup, but will work with a BG:EE setup, and the EET merge process
will manage to include them.

![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
Necessary if you want to include BG:SOD in your BG:EET setup - less of
a weidu mod and more of a mandatory tool to execute.

- [bg1npc](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/BG1NPC/releases/tag/v30)
![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
Adds WAY more banter/conversations with original BG1 npcs.

Use "Travel Triggers" install option.  High level campaign with 5
custom npcs ranging in level from 9 to 15.  R.A. Salvatore based
theme, up to +4 weapons can be found - about 5 hours of content.

![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)

### Sundry/Miscellaneous

- [EET](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET)
![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
A bit self-referential in this section, but this lets BG:EE and BG2:EE
merge into one big campaign (BG:SOD as well!)

- [Ascension](https://github.com/InfinityMods/Ascension/releases)
![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
Aligns a lot of the TOB storyline and behavior to match the original
dev intentions.  Necessary towards top of install order (which is why
it's here, not in quests).

- [Longer Road](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/37579/longer-road-working-in-bg2ee)
![dependson](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependson-ascension-orange?style=plastic)

![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
Enjoy experiencing the Black Pits as part of the game campaign,
instead of a standalone experience.

- [Rogue Revisions](http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/rr)
![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
Lots of gameplay enhancements for rogues (pickpocket without instantly
being attacked by an entire town on failure!)

- [Lore from Learning](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/tweaks/lore/)
![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
Build up CHARNAME's "Lore" stat based on various game activity (read a
book!)

- [Bubb Remove Stoneskin color](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1174034#Comment_1174034)
![ahungry](https://img.shields.io/badge/yay-ahungry-green?style=plastic)
If you miss seeing those colorful robes, this mod is for you.

Self explanatory in the name.

- [IWDification](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/spells/iwdification/)
